# FilesAndDataStructures
Final project subject programing principles

The program perform some exploratory data analysis on a dataset of worldwide carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions in the year 2016.

# Data Source
Ritchie, H. & Roser, M. (2020). CO₂ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions. Our World in Data. https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions

The program start, it prompt the user for the dataset file name and load its data into memory in appropriate data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries etc.).
Next, The program  present the user with a main menu containing these options:

(1) CO2 emissions breakdown: For a user-selected country, calculate the per-capita CO2 emissions and its components (coal, cement, gas etc.). Display the results in kilograms per person (1 million tonne equates to 109 kilograms). Also show the CO2 component breakdown as a pie chart. Note that all components are not present for each country — some columns may be empty. You should only show the CO2 components that are present.

(2) Maximum emissions per GDP: Work out and display the country which had the highest total-GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions per dollar of GDP.

(3) Top 10 GHG countries: For the user-selected greenhouse gas (methane, nitrous oxide, total), work out the top ten countries according to per capita gas emissions. Show their emission values in the form of a bar chart.

(4) Energy consumption distribution: Calculate the per capita energy consumption of all countries in kWh units (1 TerraWatt-hour = 106 kiloWatt-hour). Show the energy consumption values in the form of a box chart.

(5) Exit the program
